Hi again. Earlier we explored how to design products that solve users' problems and give them meaningful experiences. We covered the first three stages of the design process: empathize, define and ideate.

Now that you've used empathy to identify and define a key user problem and ideated a solution, what's next? The prototype stage. We'll define prototypes in more in detail later. But for now, you can think of a prototype as an interactive representation of your design solution. In this module, we'll transition from wireframes to low-fidelity prototypes. First, we'll create paper prototypes. Next, we'll learn from Figma about how to use their tool to create digital prototypes. Then, I'll demonstrate how to create a low-fidelity digital prototype in Figma. Finally, we'll explore ways to recognize potential bias in your designs and learn how to avoid deceptive patterns. Let's get started!
