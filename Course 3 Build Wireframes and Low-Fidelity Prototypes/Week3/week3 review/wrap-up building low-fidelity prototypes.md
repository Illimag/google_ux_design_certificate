Hi again. It's me, Karen. Congratulations on making it through building your first low-fidelity prototype. I'm sure you're excited to finally see your design on paper. First, you learned about paper prototypes and built your very first prototype. Next, you learned about your first design tool, Figma. Using this new design tool, you built your first digital prototype for your app. That's a lot of firsts. After doing all that work, you began to think about bias and deceptive patterns and how you can avoid these to build inclusive products. You've done a lot of work to get to this point. Now that you've created your first prototype, you're shaping up to be an amazing UX designer. Next, you'll begin thinking about how to conduct research on your prototype and how to effectively test it with your target users.
