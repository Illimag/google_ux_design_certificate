Hi there. Now that you have a paper prototype, it's time to transition it into a digital one to get a feel for how the final product will operate. Revisiting the UX design application Figma, we will make our paper prototype come to life. This will be similar to when we explored converting a paper wireframe into a digital wireframe using the same application. Remember, Figma is considered an all-in-one tool. It provides both design and prototype capabilities. You'll notice that your prototypes will look different than the ones in the upcoming videos. That's okay. You are currently working on simple lo-fi prototypes and the ones you'll see in the next video are more complex high-fidelity prototypes. As we mentioned before, we'll explore hi-fi prototypes later on. Just keep in mind that the tools we'll explore can be used for both low-fidelity and high-fidelity designs. Many of the skills we'll learn to build a digital prototype are transferable to other UX design applications like Adobe XD or Sketch. Once we finish exploring Figma's prototype tools, we'll discover what makes lo-fi prototypes different from hi-fi prototypes and how they are similar. I'll see you again soon.
