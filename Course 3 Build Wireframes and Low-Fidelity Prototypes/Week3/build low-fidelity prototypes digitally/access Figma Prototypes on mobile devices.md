Activity Exemplar: Practice creating a low-fidelity CoffeeHouse prototype in Figma
Here is a completed exemplar of the previous activity. As you view the prototype below, note that it lets the user explore the potential functionality of the app, and it lets them understand how information is displayed and prioritized.

View the prototype on Figma's website. Click on the labeled buttons to navigate through the prototype.

Notice how this prototype: 

Connects all the screens required to complete the primary user flow

Allows users to move backward and forward

Includes navigational cues (the buttons look like buttons). For instance, the “Start New Order” element is visually different from the “Team Favorites” element seen above. One is a button that a user can interact with, and the other is a header for a section. 

The primary user flow for the prototype is starting a new order, adding items to it, and then paying for that order. This prototype’s task also has an end and sends users back to the home screen after completion. 

Now compare the exemplar above to your completed deliverable. Assess what you’ve done using each of the criteria used here to evaluate the exemplar. 

As you evaluate your work, review the following criteria and make sure it fulfills each one:

All of the wireframes required to complete the main user flow are included.

There is a way for users to proceed forward and backward within the flow.

Cues for navigation are clearly indicated within the prototype.

Successful completion of the simulated activity is indicated for users.

Users return to a sample origin after completing the simulated activity.
