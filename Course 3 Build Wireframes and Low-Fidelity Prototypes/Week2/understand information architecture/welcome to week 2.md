Hello, again. So far, you've drawn a wireframe for products that already exist, like Google Photos. This is a great way to practice wireframing, because you have a real product to reference and try to replicate. Coming up, you'll learn how to build wireframes for a new product or feature. To do this, we will: Focus on organizing the information in your wireframe using what we call information architecture; draw lots of wireframes on paper for a new product; transition from paper wireframes to digital wireframes in Figma, which I'll demonstrate; hear directly from Figma about how to best use their tool; and learn about a few Gestalt principles that you can apply to your wireframes. This is an action-packed part of the course, so get ready to explore the wide world of wireframes. Let's get going.
