That wraps up our introduction to wireframes. Let's recap everything you've learned so far. You started by learning how to use research to inform the ideation process. Then, you came up with goal statements. Next, you learned how to create two types of storyboards, big picture and close up. And finally, you explored what a wireframe is, how to draw one, and the benefits of wireframes. Keep in mind that at this point in the design process, you should have lots of ideas that address a real user need. You want to refine those ideas, and wireframing can help you do that.

Coming up, we'll explore ways to wireframe on paper and digitally. You'll even create your own digital wireframe in Figma. I can't wait to continue on this journey with you. I hope you're excited about drawing because there's more to come. See you soon!
