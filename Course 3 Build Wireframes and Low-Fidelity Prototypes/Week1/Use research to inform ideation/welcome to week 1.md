Welcome back. It's Karen again. You've just learned about competitive audits and begun your design process by using exercises like Crazy Eights and How Might We. Now it's time to take what you've started to design and begin thinking about storyboarding and wireframes. First, you'll get a refresher on best practices in research and how to create problem statements. Next, you'll learn about goal statements and apply those to your project. After that, you'll learn about user flows and how to outline flows through your project. Then using those goals statements and user flows, you'll begin learning about storyboards. Lastly, you'll begin drawing your first set of wireframes. I hope you're excited. Gather up all your design exercises and let's start working on wireframes.
