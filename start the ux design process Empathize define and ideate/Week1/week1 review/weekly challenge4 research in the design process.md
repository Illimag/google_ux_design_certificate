Question 10
In a usability study, how does the user interact with a product?


1 point

In an open, public environment with guests and real-world distractions

Question 11
A design team decides to conduct interviews to learn more about users’ experiences with their product. Although this is a valuable method of primary research, why might the design team be concerned about conducting interviews? Select all that apply.


1 point

>Interviews require a significant investment of time and money



Designers need to identify a large group of potential respondents



>Interviews collect information from only a small sample of users 



Designers can only ask about how easy it is to use a product


12.
Question 12
Consider the following scenario: 

Imagine that a UX designer creates an app for saving, organizing, and streaming podcasts. To learn about users' experiences with their product, the designer conducts interviews with a select group of target users: podcast enthusiasts. The research team has a hypothesis that podcast enthusiasts prefer long-form, polished content—rather than talk radio and news—so they ask a series of questions about how users interact with this content. 

How can the researcher avoid the impact of confirmation bias? Select all that apply.
