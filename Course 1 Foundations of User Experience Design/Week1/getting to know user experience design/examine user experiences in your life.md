Examine user experiences in your life
Start to pay attention to good and bad designs that stand out in your everyday life. What do you notice about the design of apps or websites that you use frequently? Have you noticed any designs that make you feel a strong response? Share two examples from your own life:

A user experience you think is great and why

A user experience you think needs improvement and why

Please include a written response of one to two paragraphs (100-200 words). Then, check out what other learners have written, and comment on at least two of their posts.
