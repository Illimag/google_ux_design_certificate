Begin the Google UX Design Certificate
Hello and welcome! The program you’re about to begin is specifically designed to help every type of learner successfully earn the certificate and become an entry-level user experience (UX) designer. You may be re-entering the workforce after some time off, an artist without a formal design education, or a technology professional with a curiosity to learn about the magic of UX design. Regardless of your background, this certificate program will help you become an entry-level UX designer in less than six months, and no previous experience is necessary. To succeed in this program, you just need to be excited to learn about how user experience design influences the world around you!

Become job-ready
As the use of technology increases every day, the need for user experience (UX) designers continues to grow. UX designers focus on the experience that users have while using products like websites, apps, and physical objects. UX designers make those everyday interactions useful, enjoyable, and accessible. That's why organizations of all kinds, in varied industries, need to hire UX designers. We are excited to guide you on this journey to become a UX designer, as you learn the skills to begin a career in one of today’s most in-demand professions.

Along the way, you’ll build your professional toolbox by learning how to empathize with users and define their problems; create wireframes, mockups, and prototypes; conduct research to get feedback about your designs; and design with accessibility and equity in mind. On top of that, you’ll get real experience creating design projects in two of the industry’s most popular tools: Figma and Adobe XD. By the end of the certificate program, you'll have an online UX portfolio that showcases your projects from these courses to potential employers. 

Program overview
During each course of the program, you‘ll complete lots of hands-on activities based on real on-the-job skills for UX designers. There will be many types of learning opportunities, such as:

Videos with a Google employee as your instructor. 

In-video questions that will pop up from time to time and help check your learning as you go.

Readings to introduce new ideas and build on concepts from videos. 

Discussion forums to better understand course topics and chat with fellow learners in the program. 

Practice quizzes to test your knowledge and prepare you for graded quizzes. 

Graded assessments to measure your progress and provide valuable feedback. There is a graded assessment at the end of each week's worth of content, called a "weekly challenge." You must pass all graded assessments to obtain the certificate.

Peer reviews to provide you with practical feedback from classmates and allow you to develop artifacts for your professional portfolio.

The Google UX Design Certificate has seven courses. We strongly recommend that you complete these courses in order, as projects and content build as you progress through the material. This is the first course of the program, and it covers about four weeks of material.

Tips
As a learner, you’re bringing all of your past experiences and best learning practices to this certificate program. The designers of this curriculum have also put together a list of helpful habits that they believe will help you to be the most successful. 

Plan your time: Setting regular study times and sticking with them each week can help you make learning a part of your routine. Use a calendar or alarm clock to create a schedule. List what you plan to do each day in order to break your work down into achievable goals. If possible, create a quiet place to watch the videos, review the readings, and complete the activities, so you can really focus on the material.

Learn in order: We recommend taking the seven courses of the certificate program — and the items in each lesson — in the order they appear, as new information and concepts build on previous ones. 

Be curious: If you find an idea that gets you excited, act on it! Search for more details online, ask questions on the Coursera discussion forums, check out the external links that interest you, and take notes on your discoveries. The little things you do to support your learning along the way will take your knowledge even further and will help you stand out to employers. 

Take notes: Notes are useful for remembering information that you think might be important in the future, especially as you’re preparing to enter a new job field. In addition, taking notes is an effective way to make connections between topics and gain a better understanding of those topics. Search online for effective note-taking methods, if you'd like some advice.

Chat (responsibly) with other learners: If you have a question, chances are, you’re not alone. Reach out in the discussion forum to chat and ask for help from other learners taking this program. You can search through existing threads or start a new one with peers about a topic you want to learn more about. You can also visit Coursera’s Global Online Community. Other important things to know while you’re making friends can be found in the Coursera Honor Code and the Code of Conduct.

Update your profile: Consider updating your profile on Coursera. This link appears in the menu when you click on your name at the top-right corner of this screen. When classmates find you in the discussion forums, they can click on your name to view your profile and get to know you better.

Congratulations on choosing to take this first step toward becoming a part of the wonderful world of user experience. Enjoy the journey!
