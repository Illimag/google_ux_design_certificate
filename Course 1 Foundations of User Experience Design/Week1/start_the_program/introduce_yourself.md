Your introduction should give your fellow learners a good idea of who you are. Try to write a minimum of 150-200 words. If you don't know what to write, here are a few suggestions: 

Why are you interested in learning about user experience design?  

What kinds of projects would you like to work on with your new UX design knowledge? Share your passion for designing or drawing. 

Where are you from? Or where do you currently live? (If you wish to include this information in your post, don't give away specific details like your personal mailing address.) 

What’s your work and education history? Are you currently pursuing a change in careers or more education? 

What are your other interests? Put something in your post that will help others relate to you.

Don’t forget to check out what others have shared about themselves. Say "hi" to at least three of your fellow learners and make connections with them!
