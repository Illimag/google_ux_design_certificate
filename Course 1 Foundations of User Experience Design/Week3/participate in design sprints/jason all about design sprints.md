The goal of a design sprint is to take really complex problems and come together with other people on your team, like product managers, engineers, and marketing, and try to solve that problem together. You do it over the course of a week. You do multiple design activities, from wireframing and prototyping, and then at the end of the week, test with users. It's a really good way to get quick feedback and test those initial hypotheses. That's why it's so important to bring people with multiple perspectives together. Now, you may bring this fresh new perspective and you may have somebody else with historical knowledge on this project. But we also are bringing people together from product management and marketing to bring all of these unique perspectives. I think that this just proves that sprints at their core are about inclusivity.

We really want to bring people together with multiple perspectives to surface these multitude of ideas. It's always important to understand who your participants are, and make sure that this overall experience is thoughtful. You put everyone's needs first. I think that it's, in a way, a condensed version of your user experience job. Where, right now, when you're designing a sprint, these participants are your users, and it's important to understand their needs and put them first when designing a sprint.
