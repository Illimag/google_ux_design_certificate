That's a wrap. I hope you've enjoyed learning all about design sprints this week. Let's do a quick review of what we've covered. First, you learned what a design sprint is and the benefits it offers. Then you moved on to what an entry level designer's role is in a design sprint before finishing with design retrospectives. I hope all of this information was valuable. See you next week.
