During this certificate program, you will be asked to complete a few short surveys. These are part of a research study to understand how effective the certificate program has been for learners like you. This reading provides a summary of the topics that each survey will cover.

Your survey participation is optional but extremely helpful in making this certificate program the best that it can be. There are no right or wrong answers to the survey questions. Your responses and personal data will:

Not affect your course experience, scores, or ability to receive a certificate or job in any way.

Be kept confidential, with your name separated from your data.

Not be shared outside of our research team, except where you give permission to share contact information with hiring partners.

Thank you for your consideration and time! 

Entry survey
In the next course item, you will have the opportunity to fill out a brief survey to help us understand why you have enrolled in this certificate program. If you donâ€™t fill out the survey now, you will receive a reminder to fill it out after watching one video or completing one assignment. 

The survey will ask about your experiences leading up to this certificate program and the goals you hope to accomplish. This is critical information to make sure we can meet the needs of learners, like you, and can continue to offer this program in the future.

Individual course feedback
When you complete the last graded assignment within each of the seven courses, you may be asked to complete a survey that revisits earlier questions and asks what you have learned up to that point in the program. Again, filling out this information is voluntary, but it's extremely beneficial to the certificate program content development team and future learners.

Certificate completion survey
After you complete the last graded assignment in the final course of the certificate program, you will be asked to answer a survey that revisits some earlier questions and asks what you have learned throughout the duration of the certificate program. This survey also asks if you would like to share your contact information with prospective employers. Both filling out the survey and sharing your contact information with prospective employers is optional. Again, participating in the survey or sharing your information with future employers will not affect your course experience, scores, or ability to receive a certificate or job in any way.
