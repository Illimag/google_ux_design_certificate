Helpful tips to get started
You're about to jump into the content of the first course of the Google UX Design Certificate! Here are three helpful tips to keep in mind as you complete the certificate program over the next few months.

Provide feedback on course content
Three different personas 
Give feedback about videos, readings, activities, and other course materials. Just open the resource, and find the thumbs-up and thumbs-down icons. 

Click the thumbs-up icon for materials that are helpful. 

Click the thumbs-down icon for materials that are not helpful.

Click the flag icon to raise a specific issue with the item. Then, select a category, and type an explanation in the text box. This feedback goes to the course developers, not other learners, and helps create even better programs in the future. 

For technical help, visit the Learner Help Center. For help accessing course materials, click the “Contact us” link at the bottom of the page.

Obtain the Google UX Design Certificate

After you complete all seven courses in this program, you will qualify for the Google UX Design Certificate. You can review videos, readings, discussion forums, in-video questions, and practice quizzes in the program for free. However, to access graded assignments and be eligible to receive your official Google UX Design Certificate, you must:

Pass all required assignments in all seven courses with a score of 80% or higher. You can also meet the course-passing threshold of 80% with a cumulative graded score. 

AND

Pay the Course Certificate Fee or apply and be approved for a scholarship. 

Please note: You can review videos, readings, discussion forums, and practice quizzes for free, by auditing the courses. However, you have to upgrade to the certificate program to unlock the graded assessments and earn the official certificate. In other words, auditors have free view access to all course materials, but are unable to submit any assignments for a grade.

Throughout this certificate program, you will learn the foundations of user experience design. We will provide a lot of information through videos, readings, and hands-on activities. But sometimes, you may need to look things up on your own for additional context. Things change fast in this growing field, so it is critical that you do your own research and stay up-to-date on the field of UX design.
