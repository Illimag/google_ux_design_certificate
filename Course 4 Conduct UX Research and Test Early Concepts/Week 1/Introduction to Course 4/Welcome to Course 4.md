Welcome to Course 4
Welcome to Course 4 Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts
Welcome to Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts, the fourth of seven courses in the Google UX Design Certificate. You're almost halfway through the program, so keep up the great work! 

In this course, you’ll continue to design a mobile app, in alignment with the project prompt from Sharpen that you selected earlier in the program. You've made your way through the empathize, define, ideate, and prototype phases of the design process for your app designs. Now, you're ready for the test phase, which is what this course is all about. You will learn how to plan and conduct a usability study to test your designs with users and gather feedback. Then, you'll modify your designs based on insights from your research. 

Content and projects in each course of this certificate program build on information practiced in earlier courses. To be successful in this course, you should complete the previous three courses of this certificate program, if you haven't already done so.

Each course of the Google UX Design Certificate is broken into weeks. You can complete courses at your own pace, but the weekly breakdowns are designed to help you finish the program in about six months total.

What will you learn during this course? Here’s a quick preview of the four weeks to come.

Week 1: Planning UX research studies. There are seven elements that your research study plan should include: the project background, research goals, research questions, key performance indicators, methodology, participants, and the script or questions you’ll ask participants. You'll explore each of these elements in detail, and you'll create your own research plan to test the mobile app designs you've developed in previous courses of the program. You'll also learn how to respect user privacy and data when conducting UX research.

Week 2: Conducting research with usability studies. Conducting research with users to get feedback about prototypes is a critical part of the design process. You'll conduct a usability study, which is a research method that assesses how easy it is for participants to complete core tasks in a design. You'll also explore how to reduce bias and be inclusive when conducting usability studies. And, you'll take notes while observing participants in a usability study.

Week 3: Analyzing and synthesizing research results. After you conduct a usability study, you'll have a ton of feedback from participants. In this part of the course, you'll analyze and synthesize all of the feedback from your research. You'll gather data and observations in one place, organize the data using an affinity diagram, find themes, and come up with actionable insights.

Week 4: Sharing research insights for better designs. As a UX designer, it's important to share and promote the insights from your research. You’ll learn techniques for presenting insights to various audiences, and you'll improve your presentation skills to grab your audience's attention. In addition, you'll iterate on your designs, which means making revisions to create new-and-improved designs, based on insights from your research.

Portfolio project 
graphical user interface, application
As you make your way through this certificate program, you will create projects to include in your professional portfolio to show to potential employers. In this course, you’ll continue to design the mobile app that you've worked on for the past two courses. For example, if you selected a prompt to design an app for your local burger restaurant in Course 2 of the program, you will continue through the design process with this same project. 

In Course 2, you learned how to empathize with potential users and define users’ needs. 

In Course 3, you came up with ideas for solutions that addressed the users’ needs. You also created wireframes and a low-fidelity prototype of your app. 

Now, in Course 4, you will plan and conduct research to test your designs and get feedback from users. 

Next, in Course 5, you will create mockups and a high-fidelity prototype of your app for a second round of testing. 

Everything you build in the courses of this program will eventually be included in your online portfolio. Taking the courses in this certificate program in order will allow you to follow the steps of the design process and end up with all of the artifacts you’ll need to include in your portfolio. Keep up the great work with your mobile app designs!
