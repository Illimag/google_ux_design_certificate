Hi again, you've just finished learning about some great tools for empathizing with users and understanding their pain points. We discussed how to recruit participants for interviews and how to conduct interviews in a way that helps build the strongest insights into the user experience. Then you learned how to use the transcripts from the interview to build empathy maps to identify user pain points and develop personas that speak directly to the user experience. In the next part of the course will cover even more tools commonly used by UX designers in the empathize phase. Meet you there.
