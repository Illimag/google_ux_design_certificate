Activity Exemplar: Craft user stories for the CoffeeHouse project
Here are two completed examples of user stories, along with an explanation of how these examples fulfill the expectations for the activity. 

Exemplar with a star icon 
User story one: Anika
Anika is a marketing intern at a midsized advertising firm. Twice a week, they collect 6-12 coffees from a nearby coffee shop for their team before their morning meeting. But sometimes they find that their order is incomplete or has gotten cold from waiting too long for them to pick it up. They need a way to place an order in advance, track order status, and better plan their arrival for pick-up. 


“As a marketing intern who collects coffee orders for the team, I want to submit and monitor group orders in advance so that I can better manage order accuracy and plan pickup time.”
User story two: Ali
Ali is a line cook who lives in a small city and mostly works in the evenings. During the daytime, Ali does an online coding boot camp for 3-4 hours to learn a new employable skill. They usually do the boot camp from local coffee shops, but sometimes get frustrated at the limited seating. They also worry about losing their table if they get up to place a new coffee or food order. Ali could use the CoffeeShop app to reserve an in-shop workspace and place their CoffeeShop order through the app once they’ve arrived.

In the exemplar, note that each question (who, what, and why) is answered for each persona. Anika and Ali both have one-sentence user stories to help prioritize design goals by the end of the exercise.

Now compare the examples above to your completed user stories. Assess what you’ve done using each of the criteria below to evaluate the examples. Does your user story clearly identify the:

Type of user?

The “action” that the user hopes will happen?

The “benefit” the user would receive if the action happens? 

If so, great work! If not, reread the instructions and craft another user story with these criteria in mind.
