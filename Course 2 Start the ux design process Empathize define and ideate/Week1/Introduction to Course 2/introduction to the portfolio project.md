As you complete courses in this certificate program, you'll create projects for your portfolio to show off your work to potential employers. It’s a very exciting time because you’re about to begin your first design project! 

To start, you’ll select a project prompt using the prompt generator from Sharpen in the next activity. Then, over the next few courses, you’ll continue to build on your mobile app designs. 

Here, in Course 2: Start the UX Design Process: Empathize, Define, and Ideate, you'll learn how to empathize with potential users, define users’ needs, and start to come up with ideas for design solutions. 

Next, in Course 3: Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Prototypes, you'll continue to come up with ideas for solutions that address users’ needs. You’ll sketch storyboards, create wireframes, and build a low-fidelity prototype of your app in a design tool called Figma. 

In Course 4: Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts, you'll plan and conduct research to test your designs and get feedback from users.

In Course 5: Create High-Fidelity Designs and Prototypes in Figma, you'll create mockups and a high-fidelity prototype of your app for a second round of testing. 

Everything you create during the activities of this program will be included in your portfolio. Be sure to take the courses of this certificate program in order, so that you'll follow the steps of the design process and create all of the artifacts you’ll need for your portfolio. 

Choose a prompt using Sharpen
You might be thinking: There are so many products I want to design! How will I ever choose? To help narrow the scope, your first project will focus on designing a mobile app to meet the specific need of a hypothetical business or organization. You’ll choose a prompt that will give you more specific guidelines. For example, your project prompt might be to design a mobile app for the checkout process at your favorite hometown restaurant. Or, the prompt might be to design an app for a rapper’s album pre-order. There are tens of thousands of project prompts you’ll be able to choose from — the choice is yours! 

You’ll find all of these project prompts from Sharpen, an online tool that creates randomized design prompts, in the next activity. The format of the prompts from Sharpen are similar in style to the prompts you'll be asked in real job interviews! Your first project will focus on designing a process within a mobile app, and the prompt generator will give you lots of ideas to choose from. 

To produce a prompt, click on the “New Challenge” button. You can refresh the prompt as many times as you want to find one that sparks your creative energy. For this project, you’ll choose just one prompt that you'll design over the next few courses of the program, so find one that really speaks to your interests or experiences. When you find a prompt that you like, take a screenshot or write it down, so that you can submit your choice of project prompt in an upcoming quiz.

One more thing: If you already have an idea for a design project in mind, you will have the opportunity to work on the project of your choice in Course 7 of the certificate program. For this first project, please use a prompt from Sharpen to ensure your project has an appropriate scope and aligns with the course materials presented.

Build your case study
As you work through Courses 2-5 of the Google UX Design Certificate, you'll collect artifacts for your portfolio case study in a slide deck. A slide deck is a versatile format that can be used to gather, present, and share your work. It is also a widely used format in the professional world. A lot goes into building a strong case study, so it’s best to add to it as you complete activities. This way, you can spend more time making sure each slide is ready to impress. 

Use the template we provide below to organize and build your case study as you progress through courses. Feel free to customize the template to match your brand. We’ll also provide you with reminders each time you should add an artifact to your slide deck. By the end of Course 5, you’ll have a complete case study to include in your portfolio website and to showcase during your future job applications! 

To use the template for the case study, click the link below and select “Use Template.”

Here are some tips to help you use the slide deck template: 

Use the instructional language and placeholder shapes on each slide to help guide what content you should include. To replace the placeholder text, select it, then type new text. Remember, this template is just to help get you started, you can change the font and formatting however you like. 

To include images of your UX artifacts in your slides, either screenshot or download them to your device. Then, go to the slide where you’d like to add an image, choose Insert from the top menu, navigate to Image, and select Upload from computer from the dropdown menu. From here, upload the screenshot or downloaded image you want to display. 


Resize and place the image however you think it best complements the other content on the slide. Don’t forget to delete any placeholder shapes or text from the template. 

Revisit these instructions whenever you need, and keep in mind that, just like UX design is an iterative process, building a case study also takes time and multiple iterations. Be patient and thoughtful as you create each slide, and you’ll soon have a full case study ready to share with an audience.
