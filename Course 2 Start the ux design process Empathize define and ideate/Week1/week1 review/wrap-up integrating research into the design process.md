Hey, there. Let's take a moment to review what you've learned recently. You started with the basics in understanding the role that UX research plays in the design process. Remember: The goal of user experience research is to prioritize the user. You also examined how UX research fits into the development of a product, including foundational research, design research, and post-launch research. Then you were introduced to two ways to categorize research methods: primary and secondary research, and quantitative and qualitative research. As part of that conversation, you went through the benefits and drawbacks to popular research methods, like secondary research, interviews, surveys, and usability studies. Finally, we talked about identifying and avoiding biases. You've come a long way. Keep up the good work!
