Hi there, you've just spent some time learning about problem statements and hypothesis statements, and you've created some to connect to the needs of your users. Now that you've had some time to think about what your users need, it's important to start thinking about how your product meets those needs. This is known as a value proposition. A value proposition is the reason why a consumer should use a product or a service. You can think of this statement as the reason users will be interested and willing to engage with your product. Value propositions ensure that users have a reason to use the product that you are creating, as opposed to any other product currently available. As you think about the value proposition for your first project, your first step should be to answer these two important questions. What does your product do? And why should the user care? Once you answer these questions, you can start thinking about all the amazing things that your app will do. You should avoid thinking about implementation at this stage, let your imagination run free. Let's take a look at the gym app, we've been discussing in this course. We know that this gym app needs to have a list of classes for users and the ability to sign up for those classes. Here are a few other things that our app could do. Easy access to book private trainers. Reservations for popular machines. Make music requests in the gym. On-demand videos for in-home exercises. Sign up for workout classes. Track workouts on the app via fitness devices. Now, that you have a list of possible features for the app, you can sort these features into a category. Let's go back to our earlier example with Amal. Amal is an athlete who needs a way to sign up for workout classes, because the class he wants to participate in fills up fast. Our main focus right now is helping users like Amal, plan visits to the gym. Let's take a look at our list with Amal in mind and cross out those features that don't fit his needs. That leaves us with the following value propositions. Easy access to book private trainers, reservations for popular machines, sign up for workout classes. And those are our value propositions for the gym app. Having more categories and users allows you to tailor each value proposition to the user's needs. We know Amal's main focus is on booking a workout class. So that would be the value proposition that speaks to his needs. Let's suppose that Leela is currently looking for a gym membership. She wants to be in and out of the gym within an hour, so she can make her daily visit to see her mother. What appeals to Leela is the ability to reserve a machine and get the exact workout she wants on her schedule. For users on a tight schedule, like Leela, popular machine reservations are crucial. Now that you have a deeper understanding of how to build value propositions and how they affect users. It's time to start thinking about the value propositions for your app.
