
That's a wrap. We've discussed the empathize phase in detail and have now entered the define phase. Along the way, we learned how to empathize with users, build an empathy map, understand user pain points, explore personas, write user stories, identify happy paths and edge cases, discover the benefits of user journey maps, incorporate accessibility and inclusion into UX design and write problem statements, and hypothesis statements. Next, we'll move into the ideation phase. See you there.
