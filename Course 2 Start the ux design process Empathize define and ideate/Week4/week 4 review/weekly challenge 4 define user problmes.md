Question 2
Fill in the blank: To write a problem statement, you include the name of the user, their characteristics, and a description of _____.

Question 3
Can an effective problem statement help UX designers set benchmarks for success?


1 point

>Yes. Problem statements explain the user’s need, which helps designers benchmark a successful design solution. 



No. Problem statements address the process of solving a design problem, and do not address how to set success benchmarks. 



Sometimes. Problem statements may address benchmarks for success later in the design process, after prototype development and user testing.

False

Question 5
In the 5 W’s framework, researchers ask five “w” questions based on who, what, when, where, and why. What are the benefits of answering the five “w” questions when crafting a problem statement?


1 point

Users can share feedback with researchers using open-ended statements



>Researchers can empathize with the user, while clearly defining the user problem



Researchers can craft potential user problems from a designer’s point of view



Users can pose questions to researchers, to help align on design decisions

Question 6
In the 5 W’s framework, researchers ask five “w” questions based on who, what, when, where, and why. Which of the following is an example of a good “why” question?


1 point

Why has the problem not yet been solved?



Why is the problem worth a designer’s time?



Why is the user in the target group?



>Why is the problem important?

Question 7
Which of the “w” questions (who, what, when, where, or why) is missing from the following problem statement? 

The user, Shandel, is a fine arts enthusiast that lives in a major city. Shandel goes to museums several times a month. They want an easy way to secure timed museum tickets. The product Shandel uses to secure tickets requires advance purchase, so they get frustrated when they try to spontaneously book tickets to popular exhibits. Shandel wants to be able to easily book tickets in the app, in real time on weekend afternoons, without advance planning.

Question 8
Imagine that a designer is ready to build a value proposition for their new mobile app. To start, they need to conduct research that answers which of the following questions? Select all that apply.


1 point

What target users should I design for?

Question 9
Consider the following scenario: 

A designer starts to develop the value proposition for their new mobile photo app. First, they describe the product’s features and benefits, which include free unlimited photo storage and social media integration. Then, they explain the value of the product, and hone in on the features that create real value for users. 

What are the next steps the designer needs to take to develop a value proposition? Select all that apply.


1 point

>Connect the features and benefits with the needs of users



Conduct user research to identify pain points



>Review the official value proposition list



Begin market research to set a product price

Question 10
A designer is developing the value proposition for a product. Should they consider what is valuable to the user? 


1 point

>Yes. The goal is to identify what’s truly valuable to the user, and connect benefits and features to actual user needs.



No. The goal is to develop value propositions that are different from the competition, and to ensure features and benefits exceed those of competitors.



Sometimes. The goal is to balance the needs of users with design best practices, and target designs to users most likely to appreciate them.
