Hi again. Remember the design thinking process? So far, we've been focused on the empathize phase. All of our work on empathizing with the user will help us define the problem, which is where we're at now, moving from the empathize phase into the design phase. As we've discussed, design exists to solve user's problems. To start defining the design problem, we'll need to synthesize everything we've learned in the empathize stage, including pain points, personas, user stories, and user journeys. Also, empathy maps can help us focus on the user's needs and problems they are experiencing. Let's get started.
